# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
If you've read my (still incomplete) portfolio recently, you might know that I used to be absolutely obsessed with anything relating to weather. If the younger me saw that the current me made this, it would have absolutely made their day.

This weather dashboard allows you to search for a city, and this application gives you the current weather conditions in that city as well as a five-day forecast for it. Up to eight cities you've previously searched for are saved, allowing you to get weather conditions for each one with the click of a button.

Weather data is powered by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).
